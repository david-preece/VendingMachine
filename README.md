Simple command line "vending machine". More updates to come.

Back story for this app. My friend has been working on an rpg style learning tool for work and asked me to help him out.
One of the projects was to create a simple vending machine style app. This was originally in Java, the game to a stand
still for a while and i took the general idea and ran with it. First thing i did was convert it to C# and start breaking
the whole system down into seperate "units". Using interfaces to "slot" in the different parts to the main vending machine.

The current state is no way finished but demonstrates the use of dependancy injection and unit tests. Some refactoring
is needed to clean up the code and get it to a state i would be happy with. Also some of the features are missing at the
moment.

Please feel free to contact me regarding anything to do with this code.
